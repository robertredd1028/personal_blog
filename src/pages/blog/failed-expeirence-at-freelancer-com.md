Before I dive into freelanceing, I heard there are too much competition, and too saturated field. I had this in prepared, but the truth still hit me hard.

## Scammers around
I have been finding clients around one month, and did received some messages from some project posters. But some of them are scammers. Not really wanted a freeelancer to work. They will lure you to add their contacts on telegram or whatsapp, doing some work for free, or just scam the information of you identity.

## Two much competition
You will find there are two more competitions from Indias and Pakistans. Over 100+ appliants is a usual thing for one project. And the price is insanely low. Even it's difficult to get the client to see your bid because of two much applicants.

## Dead projects
Once you hang round for a while, you will find there are a lot projects ended up dead, or archived. There are no winning bid, and no further activities since the person posted the job request.

## Vague job descriptions
Some project's description is too vague, the clients even don't know what their needs or requirements. You will find the commulication is difficult. It's easy to end up with doing too much and paying too low.

## Summary
By far, I found it's just wast time to try to find work on freeelancer.com or upwork.com. It's just too much competition and too lower price. If you're a developer or designer, I don't think is a good way to find work there.
